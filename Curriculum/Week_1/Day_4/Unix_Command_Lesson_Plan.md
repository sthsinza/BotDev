# INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES 
 A.	Anticipatory Set: Draw student’s attention by telling them they are going learn how people worked on computers in the early age by only using a monitor and a keyboard
 
 # B.	Body: 
# 1.	What is a terminal?

Terminal is program which provides a text-based interface for a user to navigate through the computer. Windows operating system uses the name “Command Prompt” for it and other operating systems call it as “Terminal”. 

# 2.	UNIX Commands

UNIX commands are the syntaxes are used in the terminal for the user to navigate through the program. It allows the users to make directories, files and even write codes on which is known as shell scripting. 

## **Note: UNIX is case sensitive**
### i.	ls
ls allows the users to list all the files in a directory (folder).

### ii.	ls –l
Ls –l lists all the files in a directory in a long format. Long format shows all the detailed information of the files such as the ownership of the files, who can view and edit the file and the exact file size.

### iii.	cd 
cd means “change directory”, which simply allows the users to go from one file to another. Typing cd DirectoryName in the terminal makes the users go from one directory to another.

### iv.	cd ..
cd .. is the “Back” button syntax for the terminal. Whenever a user wants to go back to the previous directory, they can just type cd ..

### v.	pwd
pwd tells the users where they currently are.

### vi.	clear
As the name suggests, clear cleans up the terminal and removes all the other syntaxes from the terminal.

### vii. ctrl + c
This command allows the user to stop running the code that is running for a longer period.

### viii. python
python allows the user to execute the python codes that have been programmed.

### ix.	cat
Cat allows the users to read the content in a file. To use the command, user can simply type cat fileName.

### x.	mkdir
Users can create directories using the command mkdir. To use the command, they can type mkdir directoryName.

### xi.	rm –d
rm –d allows the users to delete the directories (which has the appropriate permissions). rm –d directoryName deletes the directory.

### xii. nano
nano is a text editor in the terminal which allows the user to write text files and shell script using different language like Python and C++.

C.	Closure: 
The activity described in “Assessment”, the students will be tested on the active listening and how well they can grasp the basic commands on the terminal.
